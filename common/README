This is puppet-common a puppet module for common things.

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions on getting this installed.
Look in the examples/ folder for usage. If none exist, please contribute one!
This code may be a work in progress. The interfaces may change without notice.
Patches are welcome, but please be patient. They are best received by email.
Please ping me if you have big changes in mind, before you write a giant patch.

Module specific notes:
* This module is a useful dependency for some of my other modules.
* You may also find some of the individual pieces useful.
* I have removed functionality that now exists in the puppet "stdlib".
* Some of the functionality is so useful, that this imports types directly.

Dependencies:
* puppetlabs-stdlib (required)
* my puppet-puppet module (optional)


Happy hacking,

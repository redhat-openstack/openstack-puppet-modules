fixes:
  - when guestagent.conf is configured via template,
    it did not use the rabbit_hosts settings. This is
    now enabled. This change also moves the templated
    guestagent.conf rabbit config into the correct
    section. Finally this properly sets the ha_queues
    setting when the template is used.

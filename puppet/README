This is puppet-puppet a puppet module for puppet.

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions on getting this installed.
Look in the examples/ folder for usage. If none exist, please contribute one!
This code may be a work in progress. The interfaces may change without notice.
Patches are welcome, but please be patient. They are best received by email.
Please ping me if you have big changes in mind, before you write a giant patch.

Module specific notes:
* I've always had an issue with this module.
* I recently ripped out support for a lot of the old puppet 0.24 era features.
* I've only since tested it on the recent 3.x series.
* A lot has changed from Puppet version to version.
* It has been hard to follow this and keep it sane.
* There are serious improvements that could be made to this code.
* This module is useful for automatic deployments of puppet with vagrant.
* The puppet::vardir class is a dependency for some of my other puppet modules.

Dependencies:
* my puppet-shorewall module (optional)
* my puppet-yum module (optional)
* puppetlabs-apt module (optional, untested)


Happy hacking,

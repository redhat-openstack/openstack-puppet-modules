This is Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant! (https://ttboj.wordpress.com/)

You'll first need to get vagrant working. Here are some background articles:

I've written a detailed article about all of this, which is available here:

This will not work perfectly on Fedora 19. You must use Fedora 20 or greater.

Once you're comfortable that vagrant is working properly, run this command:

	vagrant up puppet && sudo -v && vagrant up annex{1..4} --no-parallel

Sit back and watch, or go have a beverage...
The first run can take a while because it has to download/install a base image.

When the above command completes, puppet will still be provisioning your hosts.
Once the cluster state settles, puppet will create and start a gluster volume.
Once your volume is started, you can build a few clients:

	vagrant up client{1..2} --gluster-clients=2

Happy hacking,

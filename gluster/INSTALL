To install this puppet module, copy this folder to your puppet modulepath.

You can usually find out where this is by running:

$ puppet config print modulepath

on your puppetmaster. In my case, this contains the directory:

/etc/puppet/modules/

I keep all of my puppet modules in git managed directories named:

puppet-<modulename>

You must remove the 'puppet-' prefix from the directory name for it to work!

Happy hacking!

# The baseline for module testing used by Puppet Labs is that each manifest
# should have a corresponding test manifest that declares that class or defined
# type.
#
# Tests are then run by using puppet apply --noop (to check for compilation errors
# and view a log of events) or by fully applying the test in a virtual environment
# (to compare the resulting system state to the desired state).

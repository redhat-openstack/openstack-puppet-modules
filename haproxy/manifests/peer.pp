# == Define Resource Type: haproxy::peer
#
# This type will set up a peer entry inside the peers configuration block in
# haproxy.cfg on the load balancer. Currently, it has the ability to
# specify the instance name, ip address, ports and server_names.
#
# Automatic discovery of peer nodes may be implemented by exporting the peer resource
# for all HAProxy balancer servers that are configured in the same HA block and
# then collecting them on all load balancers.
#
# === Parameters:
#
# [*peers_name*]
#  Specifies the peer in which this load balancer needs to be added.
#
# [*server_names*]
#  Sets the name of the peer server in the peers configuration block.
#   Defaults to the hostname. Can be an array. If this parameter is
#   specified as an array, it must be the same length as the
#   ipaddresses parameter's array. A peer is created for each pair
#   of server\_names and ipaddresses in the array.
#
# [*ensure*]
#  Whether to add or remove the peer. Defaults to 'present'.
#   Valid values are 'present' and 'absent'.
#
# [*ipaddresses*]
#  Specifies the IP address used to contact the peer member server.
#   Can be an array. If this parameter is specified as an array it
#   must be the same length as the server\_names parameter's array.
#   A peer is created for each pair of address and server_name.
#
# [*ports*]
#  Sets the port on which the peer is going to share the state.

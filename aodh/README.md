Overview
--------

The AODH module is a part of [OpenStack](https://github.com/openstack), an effort by the Openstack infrastructure team to provide continuous integration testing and code review for Openstack and Openstack community projects not part of the core software.  The module its self is used to flexibly configure and manage the Alarming service for Openstack.

Module Description
------------------

The AODH module is a thorough attempt to make Puppet capable of managing the entirety of AODH.  This includes manifests to provision region specific endpoint and database connections.  Types are shipped as part of the AODH module to assist in manipulation of configuration files.

Setup
-----

**What the AODH module affects**

* [AODH](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/aodh/), the Alarming service for Openstack.

### Installing AODH

    AODH is not currently in Puppet Forge, but is anticipated to be added soon.  Once that happens, you'll be able to install AODH with:
    puppet module install openstack/aodh

### Beginning with AODH

To utilize the AODH module's functionality you will need to declare multiple resources.  The following is a modified excerpt from the [openstack module](https://github.com/stackfoge/puppet-openstack).  This is not an exhaustive list of all the components needed, we recommend you consult and understand the [openstack module](https://github.com/stackforge/puppet-openstack) and the [core openstack](http://docs.openstack.org) documentation.

Implementation
--------------

### AODH

AODH is a combination of Puppet manifest and ruby code to delivery configuration and extra functionality through types and providers.

Limitations
------------

* All the AODH types use the CLI tools and so need to be ran on the AODH node.

Beaker-Rspec
------------

This module has beaker-rspec tests

To run the tests on the default vagrant node:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rake acceptance
```

For more information on writing and running beaker-rspec tests visit the documentation:

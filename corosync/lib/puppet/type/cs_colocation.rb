    together when one of them fails.  For instance, if a web server vhost
    is colocated with a specific ip address and the web server software
    crashes, the ip address with migrate to the new host with the vhost.

      in colocation groups is important. In Pacemaker, a colocation of 2 primitives
      behaves different than a colocation between more than 2 primitives. Here the
      behavior is altered to be more consistent.
      Examples on how to define colocations here:
      - 2 primitives: [A, B] will cause A to be located first, and B will be located
        with A. This is different than how crm configure colocation works, because
        there [A, B] would mean colocate A with B, thus B should be located first.
      - multiple primitives: [A, B, C] will cause A to be located first, B next, and
        finally C. This is identical to how crm configure colocation works with
        multiple resources, it will add a colocated set.
      Property will raise an error if you do not provide an array containing at least
      two values. Values can be either the name of the primitive, or primitive:role.
      Notice, we can only interpret colocations of single sets, not multiple sets
      combined. In Pacemaker speak, this means we can support 'A B C' but not e.g.
      'A B (C D) E'. Feel free to contribute a patch for this."

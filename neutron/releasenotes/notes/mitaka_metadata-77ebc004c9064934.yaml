features:
  - Add SSL parameters to communicate with Nova.
upgrade:
  - List upgrade notes here, or remove this section.
    All of the list items in this section are combined
    when the release notes are rendered, so the text
    needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any
    information only available in another section, such
    as the prelude. This may mean repeating some details.
deprecations:
  - Deprecate API parameters for metadata agent, not needed
    anymore in Mitaka.
fixes:
  - Metadata agent config should be applied after package installation.

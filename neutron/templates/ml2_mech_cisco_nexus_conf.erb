# Cisco Nexus Switch configurations.
# Each switch to be managed by Openstack Neutron must be configured here.
#
# Cisco Nexus Switch Format.
# [ml2_mech_cisco_nexus:<IP address of switch>]
# <hostname>=<intf_type:port>       (1)
# ssh_port=<ssh port>               (2)
# username=<credential username>    (3)
# password=<credential password>    (4)
# nve_src_intf=<loopback number>    (5)
# physnet=<physical network>        (6)
#
# (1) For each host connected to a port on the switch, specify the hostname
#     and the Nexus physical port (interface) it is connected to.
#     Valid intf_type's are 'ethernet' and 'port-channel'.
#     The default setting for <intf_type:> is 'ethernet' and need not be
#     added to this setting.
# (2) The TCP port for connecting via SSH to manage the switch. This is
#     port number 22 unless the switch has been configured otherwise.
# (3) The username for logging into the switch to manage it.
# (4) The password for logging into the switch to manage it.
# (5) Only valid if VXLAN overlay is configured and vxlan_global_config is
#     set to True.
#     The NVE source interface is a loopback interface that is configured on
#     the switch with valid /32 IP address. This /32 IP address must be known
#     by the transient devices in the transport network and the remote VTEPs.
#     This is accomplished by advertising it through a dynamic routing protocol
#     in the transport network. (NB: If no nve_src_intf is defined then a
#     default setting of 0 (creates "loopback0") will be used.)
# (6) Only valid if VXLAN overlay is configured.
#     The physical network name defined in the network_vlan_ranges variable
#     (defined under the ml2_type_vlan section) that this switch is controlling.
#     The configured 'physnet' is the physical network domain that is connected
#     to this switch. The vlan ranges defined in network_vlan_ranges for a
#     a physical network are allocated dynamically and are unique per physical
#     network. These dynamic vlans may be reused across physical networks.
#
# Example:
# [ml2_mech_cisco_nexus:1.1.1.1]
# compute1=1/1
# compute2=ethernet:1/2
# compute3=port-channel:1
# ssh_port=22
# username=admin
# password=mySecretPassword
# nve_src_intf=1
# physnet=physnet1

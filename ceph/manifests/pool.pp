# Manages operations on the pools in the cluster, such as creating or deleting
# pools, setting PG/PGP numbers, number of replicas, ...
#
# == Define: ceph::pool
#
# The name of the pool.
#
# === Parameters:
#
# [*ensure*] Creates ( present ) or removes ( absent ) a pool.
#   Optional. Defaults to present.
#   If set to absent, it will drop the pool and all its data.
#
# [*pg_num*] Number of PGs for the pool.
#   Optional. Default is 64 ( but you probably want to pass a value here ).
#   Number of Placement Groups (PGs) for a pool, if the pool already
#   exists this may increase the number of PGs if the current value is lower.
#   Check http://ceph.com/docs/master/rados/operations/placement-groups/.
#
# [*pgp_num*] Same as for pg_num.
#   Optional. Default is undef.
#
# [*size*] Replica level for the pool.
#   Optional. Default is undef.
#   Increase or decrease the replica level of a pool.
#

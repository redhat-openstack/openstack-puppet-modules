# == Class: cinder::backup::nfs
#
# Setup Cinder to backup volumes into NFS
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*backup_share*]
#   (required) The NFS share to attach to, to be specified in
#   fqdn:path, ipv4addr:path, or "[ipv6addr]:path" format.
#
# [*backup_driver*]
#   (optional) The backup driver for NFS back-end.
#   Defaults to 'cinder.backup.drivers.nfs'.
#
# [*backup_file_size*]
#   (optional) The maximum size in bytes of the files used to hold
#   backups. If the volume being backed up exceeds this size, then
#   it will be backed up into multiple files. This must be a multiple
#   of the backup_sha_block_size_bytes parameter.
#   Defaults to $::os_service_default
#
# [*backup_sha_block_size_bytes*]
#   (optional) The size in bytes that changes are tracked for
#   incremental backups.
#   Defaults to $::os_service_default
#
# [*backup_enable_progress_timer*]
#   (optional) Enable or Disable the timer to send the periodic
#   progress notifications to Ceilometer when backing up the volume
#   to the backend storage.
#   Defaults to $::os_service_default
#
# [*backup_mount_point_base*]
#   (optional) The base directory containing the mount point for the
#   NFS share.
#   Defaults to $::os_service_default
#
# [*backup_mount_options*]
#   (optional) The mount options that are passed to the NFS client.
#   Defaults to $::os_service_default
#
# [*backup_container*]
#   (optional) Custom container to use for backups.
#   Defaults to $::os_service_default
#
# [*backup_compression_algorithm*]
#   (optional) Compression algorithm to use when writing backup data.
#   Defaults to $::os_service_default

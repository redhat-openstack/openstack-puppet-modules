Overview

The ceilometer module is part of [Stackforge](https://github.com/stackforge), an effort by the
OpenStack infrastructure team to provice continuous integration testing and code review for
OpenStack and OpenStack community projects not part of the core software. The module itself
is used to flexibly configure and manage the metering service for OpenStack.
